# PicoCPU
A minimal 16 bit CPU built from discreet TTL chips (74181 & 74172 etc.) Based upon the 
Pathetic Instruction Set Computer (https://bradrodriguez.com/papers/piscedu2.htm)

Extensive modifications were made to improve conditionals and to add a right shift facility.

A simulator, assembler and integer compiler were also developed to support this CPU.
